# OS-Phase1
This project is the implementation of simple OS which can perform primary read and write functions. Instructions are written in OS.txt. 
At the time of program execution, commands are read from OS.txt, executed and result is stored in output.txt file.
IDE used: Codeblocks

# Commands our OS executes:

## GD : get data from given memory location 
Example : GD10

## PD : put data at given memory location
Example : PD20

## LR : load data from given memory location to register
Example : LR20

## CR

## BT

## H


# OS-Phase2
This project is the extension of OS Phase1. In phase 1, OS could perform only read, write operation and some simple execution of commands. 
In phase 2, it can detect errors and print error in the output file. 
Types of error detected by the OS are :

    1.Operation code error  
    
    2.Line limit exceeded
    
    3.Operand error
    
    4.Invalid page fault
    
    5.Out of Data Error

At the end of execution, output is stored in output.txt file.
